<a href="#" class="h3 text-secondary">Early Life</a>
                    

<p>Today, we beam our searchlight on a man best described as a phoenix who defiled all the odds and rose in the political circle. We have gathered to celebrate a consummate family man who is a complete product of grace. He is Honourable Chimaobi Sam Atu of the <code>Labour Party</code></p>

<p>Hon. Atu was elected in the February 25, 2023 elections to represent Enugu North and South Federal Constituency in the National Assembly. He defeated a three-term incumbent with <code>over sixty thousand votes.</code></p>

<p>Hon. Chimaobi Sam Atu is a real estate developer, industrialist and consummate politician. He was born in April 1982 to the family of Mr And Mrs Michael Nnamchi Atu of Umumba, Ndiaga Ugwuaji in Enugu South Local Government Area of Enugu State.

<h4><a style="color: green;">Education</a></h4>

<div class="container-fluid bg-secondary py-5">
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    
    He had his primary education at Community Primary School Ugwuaji. Given his sterling performance in basic science, his teachers recommended that the young dynamic Chimaobi should be sent to Special Science School Ihe, Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State for his secondary education. It should be mentioned that Special Science School, as it were in Eastern Nigeria, was an exclusive reserve of committed primary school leavers with creative minds.
After the successful completion of his Senior Secondary School Examinations, he gained admission to study Industrial Chemistry in the prestigious Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) Agbani. Chimaobi graduated with honours, Bachelor of Science Degree in 2006.

During his National Youth Service in Amoye Grammar School, Ikere Ekiti, “Uncle Sam”, as he was fondly called by his students, displayed rare teaching traits. Apart from his teaching activities at Amoye Grammar School, he played a key role in social reengineering in the community. As a mentor in the community school, he inspired many who looked up to him for direction.

Shortly after Chimaobi completed his National Youth Service activities, he was employed by United Geophysical Nigeria Limited (UGNL) in Agbor, Delta State. As a staff of UGNL, he initiated many projects and led the charge in several site activities.

   <h4><a style="color: green;">Entering Politics</a></h4>
 
<p>After gaining the requisite experience in the private sector and given his entrepreneurial drive, he resigned and moved back to Enugu to establish his own company, Chimfloxy Ideals. Since the establishment of Chimfloxy Ideals, the company has radically changed the real estate business in the South East. As the CEO, Mr Atu played a key role in ensuring that people built affordable homes in the South East.

Expectedly, the immediate past Governor of Enugu State, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi while in office, appointed him as an Executive Assistant (EA).
After the re-election of Governor Ugwuanyi in 2019, Hon. Chimaobi was again appointed a Technical Assistant (TA). These appointments provided Mr Atu with the opportunity to serve his State with the needed panache.</p>

As a thorough community leader, he played a critical role in the establishment of the Community Policing Initiative in Ugwuaji and its environs. He was unanimously appointed the Chairman of the Initiative. During his tenure, he dealt with the growing security concerns in Ugwuaji and other adjourning communities. He received several commendations for ensuring a near-perfect security system in his community. He was also elected the Youth Leader and Secretary General of Ndiaga Ugwuaji. It is worthy to note at this juncture, that Atu was NEVER a bus driver or a member of a vigilante group as insinuated in some quarters.

<h4><a style="color: green;">Family Life</a></h4>
                    
<p>Being a responsible promax family man, Hon Chimobi Sam Atu, happily settled with the love of his life, <code>Lolo Ugoeze Ezinne Maureen Atu.</code> And the union, blessed with godly children.</p>

His love not limited to just his family but overflowing to the community he’s determined to serve, he never withheld any good from his people.

As a philanthropist, Hon. Atu initiated many projects in his native community. He was responsible for the extension of electricity to some parts of Ugwuaji where government power infrastructure did not get to. More so, Hon. Atu provides scholarships to indigent community members at both secondary and university levels.
Since 2012, he has been financing the grading of community roads abandoned by the government.

    <h4><a style="color: green;">Recognition</a></h4>

In recognition of these qualities and unwavering contributions to his community and State, he was honoured with a chieftaincy title in 2021 as Aharu-ama of Nkanuland. To many, the chieftaincy title only explains in part, the doggedness of a young man who braced up to the challenges of life and created a niche for himself. To the young men and women who have benefited from the benevolence of Chimaobi, the chieftaincy title re-echoes his unflinching interest in human progress. For those in the religious circle, ‘brother’ Chima is a passionate church leader who has won and is still winning souls for God.

After his resounding victory in the polls, he was sworn in as a Member of the 10th National Assembly on the 13th of June, 2023. 

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it might interest you to know that just a day after their inauguration, Hon. Chimaobi Atu demonstrated to the whole world that he is a chip of the old block, by moving a motion on the floor of the National Assembly. 

Let me add at this point, that he was the FIRST among the two hundred and eighty-six First -Time lawmakers to make such move on the floor of the House.
 The motion, which was on gully erosion along New Market/Ugwuonyema/9th Mile Road, has gained Federal attention. Just few days ago, representatives of the relevant agency were at the erosion site to monitor the situation.

To further demonstrate to his constituents that he will keep to all his campaign promises, Hon. Atu has commenced the installation of solar street light in Ugwuaji. He has also finalised arrangements to install the street light in other locations in his constituency.

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, how else can we define this servant leader who has rolled up his sleeves to work for his people?
With your support and prayers, he would exceed his plans and programmes of taking this constituency to the next level.

God bless Hon. Chimaobi Sam Atu.
God bless us all.
